# Supported languages

`bueno` currently supports the following locales

* `en-US`
* `es-ES`
* `de-DE`
* `sv-SE`

Some additional locales are in progress, and contributions for
additional ones will be happily accepted. 

If you have a locale you'd like to have supported, please consider
contributing **test cases** for that locale to help with its
implementation.


**Please Note:** `bueno` always tries to generate grammatically
acceptable error messages, but it is a new library and **you will want
to double check any error messages it generates for any production
usage where incorrect grammar would appear unprofessional**.
